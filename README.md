# Case-Study-Penny-Pincher

## Problem Intro:
The data is anonymous.

Goal is to predict the class with accuracy the best it can be to minimize monetary loss.

"So what concerns me is that every time I make it into a production, I lose money. And so for every time we predict class 1 and it's not class 1, I lose $100. And then say we predict class 0 and it's not class zero, there goes another $25. My goal is I would like a model that actually predicts the class that minimizes my financial losses, and that's it. I just need to stop wasting so much money. ... That's my bottom line. Save the money. I could care less about anything else."
